Helper for building artlangs (under construction)

This repository will (hopefully, soon) host a code
for helping linguists construct aritifical languages
desciribing those languages in a declarative manner
using external DSL(s).

The proof of concept is ready and will be a basis
for the talk I'm going to give at the Lua in Moscow
Dec 2017 meetup, but I'd like to take some time
to polish the code base before publishing it.

Stay tuned!
